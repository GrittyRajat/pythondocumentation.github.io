          <h1>What is Python?</h1>
          <p>
            Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido
            van Rossum, and released in 1991.
          </p>
          <p>It is used for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>web development (server-side)</li>
            <li>software development</li>
            <li>mathematics</li>
            <li>system scripting</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Dating from 1991, the Python programming language was considered a
            gap-filler, a way to write scripts that “automate the boring stuff”
            (as one popular book on learning Python put it) or to rapidly
            prototype applications that will be implemented in other languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, over the past few years, Python has emerged as a
            first-class citizen in modern software development, infrastructure
            management, and data analysis. It is no longer a back-room utility
            language, but a major force in web application creation and systems
            management, and a key driver of the explosion in big data analytics
            and machine intelligence.
          </p>
          <h1>What can Python do?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.</li>
            <li>Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.</li>
            <li>
              Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and
              modify files.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex
              mathematics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready
              software development.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h1>Why Python?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux,
              Raspberry Pi, etc).
            </li>
            <li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
            <li>
              Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with
              fewer lines than some other programming languages.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be
              executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can
              be very quick.
            </li>
            <li>
              Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way
              or a functional way.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="syntax">
          <h1>Python Quickstart</h1>
          <p>
            Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a
            developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put
            those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
          </p>
          <p>The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>
          <code> C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py </code>
          <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.</p>

          <b><p>Execute Python Syntax</p></b>
          <p>
            As we learned in the previous page, Python syntax can be executed by
            writing directly in the Command Line:
          </p>
          <code>>>> print("Hello, World!") Hello, World!</code>
          <h1>Python Indentation</h1>
          <p>
            Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for
            readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
          </p>
          <p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>
          <code>if 5 > 2: print("Five is greater than two!")</code>
        </section>

        <section id="comments">
          <h1>Python Comments</h1>
          <p>
            Comments can be used to explain Python code or to make the code more
            readable. It used to prevent execution when testing code.
          </p>
          <p>Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:</p>
          <code>#This is a comment print("Hello, World!")</code>
          <code>print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment</code>
          <br /><br />
          <p><b>Multi Line Comments:</b></p>
          <p>
            Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a
            variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your
            code, and place your comment inside it:
          </p>
          <code
            >""" This is a comment written in more than just one line """
            print("Hello, World!")</code
          >
          <p>
            As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will
            read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline
            comment.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="variables">
          <h1>Variables</h1>
          <p>
            When you develop a program, you need to manage values, a lot of
            them. To store values, you use variables.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Python, a variable is a label that you can assign a value to it.
            And a variable is always associated with a value. For example:
          </p>
          <code
            >message = 'Hello, World!' print(message) message = 'Good Bye!'
            print(message)</code
          >
          <p>
            In this example, message is a variable. It holds the string 'Hello,
            World!'. The print() function shows the message Hello, World! to the
            screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next line assigns the string 'Good Bye!' to the message variable
            and print its value to the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The variable message can hold various values at different times. And
            its value can change throughout the program.
          </p>
          <h1>Creating variables</h1>
          <p>To define a variable, you use the following syntax:</p>
          <code>variable_name = value</code>
        </section>
        <section id="datatypes">
          <h1>Python Data Types</h1>
          <p>
            In programming, data type is an important concept. Variables can
            store data of different types, and different types can do different
            things. Python has the following data types built-in by default, in
            these categories:
          </p>
          <pre>
Text Type:  str
Numeric Types: int, float, complex
Sequence Types:   list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:  dict
Set Types:  set, frozenset
Boolean Type:  bool
Binary Types:  bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type:  NoneType
